Good Day Dear Coder,
 
I have done, implementing herbstluftwm tag for both lemonbar and dzen2.

## Blog

All I need is time, being alone to pour these script into a bunch of tutorials.

¤ Overview: 2 Articles

¤ Statusbar and HerbstluftWM: 
» Focusing on tags: herbstclient tag_status
» 7 Articles (BASH, Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Haskell)

¤ Advance Pipe and Fork: 
» Focusing on event: herbstclient --idle
» 7 Articles (BASH, Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Haskell)
» Putting it all together with other statusbar

Hints: The Haskell part is full of tricks. I'm thinking of make another Haskell article. e.g. about no mutable global state variable with haskell.

## Pipe Overview of Lemonbar in HerbstluftWM.


In shell it is basically just a pipe:

¤ herbstclient idle | content processing | lemonbar | sh

This is a three tier pipes, since content processing happened between pipe. The content processing itself is a complex part. 

Well it is challenging, and no sufficient tutorial in internet. That's is why I'm eager to pour them down in a blog.

## Dotfiles

Currently, all I have is only the script code. I haven't got time to write it down now. I'm pretty busy about the moment. And I desperately need some rest. So please, enjoy the code.

Thank you for reading.
I'll be back when the blog ready.
